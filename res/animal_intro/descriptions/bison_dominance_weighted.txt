A bison is a large bovine in the genus Bison (Greek: "wild ox") within the tribe Bovini. Two extant and numerous extinct species are recognised. While bison species have been traditionally classified in their own genus, modern genetics indicates that they are nested within the genus Bos, which includes, among others, cattle, yaks and gaur, being most closely related to yaks. Bison are sometimes bred with domestic cattle and produce offspring called beefalo or zubron.
